# Pentagon Chaos Game in C++
This repository contains the implementation of the Pentagon Chaos Game in C++. 
## Description
The Pentagon Chaos Game is a fascinating demonstration of how a simple iterative process can produce complex and beautiful patterns. This project is a C++ implementation of the game, generating a fractal pentagon.
## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile the C++ files using your preferred C++ compiler.
3. Run the executable.
4. The program will generate and display the fractal pentagon.
## Requirements
- C++ compiler
